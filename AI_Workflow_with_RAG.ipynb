    "# Simple AI Workflow with RAG using OpenRouter and Supabase\n",
    "#### Authored by Dr. Tiziana Ligorio for *AI Agents - CSCI 395.32* taught at Hunter College of The City University of New York\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we build a simple AI workflow that demonstrates the **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** pattern — a technique that grounds LLM responses in specific documentation, reducing hallucinations and enabling the model to answer questions about information not in its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a **FastHTML tutor** that can answer questions about the FastHTML library by retrieving relevant information from its documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our workflow consists of the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Loading** — Load the FastHTML documentation from a text file\n",
    "2. **Chunking** — Split the documentation into manageable pieces\n",
    "3. **Embedding** — Create vector embeddings for each chunk using OpenAI embeddings\n",
    "4. **Storage** — Store the embeddings in a Supabase vector database (Postgres + pgvector)\n",
    "5. **Retrieval** — Query the database for relevant chunks based on user questions\n",
    "6. **Generation** — Use the retrieved context to generate accurate answers\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern illustrates a fundamental concept in AI systems: **LLMs have knowledge cutoffs and can hallucinate**. By retrieving relevant context from a curated knowledge base before generating a response, we can provide accurate, up-to-date answers grounded in real documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the OpenAI SDK (with OpenRouter as our provider) for LLM calls and embeddings, and Supabase (Postgres + pgvector) for vector storage — keeping the implementation transparent with no heavy frameworks."

Here, we implement a simple character-based splitter to illustrate the core concepts."

      "Question: How do I create a route in FastHTML?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "To create a route in FastHTML, you can use the `@app.get` decorator to define a route that responds to HTTP GET requests. Here's a simple example based on the documentation:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "@app.get('/user/{nm}')\n",
      "def _(nm: str):\n",
      "    return f\"Good day to you, {nm}!\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the route is defined for the path `/user/{nm}`, where `{nm}` is a path parameter that can be captured and used in the response. When a user accesses this route with a specific name (for example, `/user/jph`), the response will be \"Good day to you, jph!\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, you can define routes using the `app.route` method, which allows you to specify the HTTP method by naming the function appropriately. However, the documentation highlights the use of decorators like `@app.get` for simplicity when defining routes for specific HTTP methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "For testing this route, you can utilize the `TestClient` as shown in the documentation:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "cli.get('/user/jph').text  # This would return \"Good day to you, jph!\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This provides a clear way to set up and test routes in a FastHTML application.\n"

      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "FastTags in FastHTML are components that allow you to create basic HTML tags using FastHTML's m-expression syntax. In this context, positional parameters become the children of the tags, while named parameters are treated as attributes of those tags. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, you can create a `Title`, `H1`, and `P` tag as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "tags = Title(\"FastHTML\"), H1(\"My web app\"), P(f\"Let's do this!\", cls=\"myclass\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example:\n",
      "- `Title(\"FastHTML\")` creates a title tag with the text \"FastHTML\".\n",
      "- `H1(\"My web app\")` creates a header tag with the text \"My web app\".\n",
      "- `P(f\"Let's do this!\", cls=\"myclass\")` creates a paragraph tag with some text and assigns a class attribute \"myclass\".\n",
